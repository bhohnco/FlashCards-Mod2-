##Flash Cards
###Overview
This was a solo project, provided in mod 2. The project was to take a partial OOP application and make it fully functional. We were tasked with building a program that simulates quizing a user through a set of flash cards. A user can see the questions, take their guess, receive immediate answer feedback, and lastly view their final score at the end of the round.

###Learning Goals and Objectives
* Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
* Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
* Implement ES6 classes
* Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

###Setup
1. Fork and clone down this repository.
2. cd into your local repository.
3. Run npm install.
4. Run node index.js from the root of your project should result in the following message being displayed in your terminal: Node server running on port 3000.
5. The flash cards game will then start.

###Challenges 
* Using arrow functions
* Implementing beforeEach in the testing files
* Getting the game to reset depending on the users score 

###Wins
* Dynamic TDD 
* More practice with creating testing files and using beforeEach
* Working through an extension
